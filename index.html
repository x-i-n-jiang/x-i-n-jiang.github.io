<h2>Xin Jiang @ USC</h2>
Welcome! I obtained my Ph.D. in Economics from UC Santa Barbara, 2024. I am a Postdoc Teaching Fellow in Economics at the University of Southern California. <br><br>

I am leading a teaching lab aimed at enhancing undergraduate instruction by introducing innovative approaches to both micro- and macroeconomic theory courses.
Drawing on my research in experimental economics, I plan to incorporate behavioral experiments into the classroom. These experiments will provide students with a 
hands-on understanding of when and why economic theories may fail, bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and real-world applications.<br><br>

While group identity can generate in-group bias, the topic of how activities generate group affiliation is largely
unexplored. We experimentally study the effect of shared experience on group affiliation, varying shared
experiences by paying subjects differently for the same task. The results show that shared fortune leads to
in-group bias, while shared misfortune does not.

<h2>Working Paper</h2>
<ul><li><b>Pinocchio's Clock: Using Response Time to Detect Deception in Sender-Receiver Games</b><br>
with Bohan Ye.<br>

The inclusion of response time stamps has become a common feature of contemporary social media sites and applications. 
What private information does the response time carry when there is a conflict of interest between users? Can people use it to 
improve their welfare in communication? We developed a framework and designed a sender-receiver experiment to examine the complex
relationship between response time and private information in communication. We find a truth discovery preference, where senders 
tend to discover the truth before sending their messages. Given this preference, the response time reflects the deliberation process 
rather than the truth discovery process. Results show that deceptive messages are significantly longer than the honest ones. 
However, the inference from the RT is limited and receivers on average do not over-use RT for lying detection.

<ul><li><b>Dynamic Binary Elicitation Method</b><br>
with Jing Zhou.<br>

Beliefs or perceptions play a central role in studying economic behavior, yet eliciting them accurately presents challenges. 
We introduce a novel elicitation method, called the Dynamic Binary Method (DBM), designed to address the common challenge individuals 
face in pinpointing the best point estimate of their beliefs, particularly when their beliefs are imprecise. Unlike Classical Methods (CM),
which require respondents to form a point estimate of their true beliefs, DBM prompts respondents to make a series of binary relative 
judgments and enables them to express interval beliefs by exiting the process at any step. After the exit, we will randomly pick a number 
in the interval as their final beliefs. 

We conduct both within-subject and between-subject experiments using a diverse range of perception tasks drawn from previous literature 
and CM as a benchmark of performances in each task. We find that, at the aggregate level, DBM does not perform significantly differently 
from CM, regardless of whether the perception tasks involve artificial/laboratory settings or real-life scenarios, and irrespective of 
the performance metric used. However, DBM has an asymmetric effect relative to CM: individuals who performed poorly under CM tend to 
improve under DBM, while those who performed well under CM tend to do worse under DBM.
