        <B>Learning Economics</B> helps me understand more about this world, including why an egg should be overpriced on The Great Wall,
        why grandparents are nicer to us than parents, our own preference is not innately obvious to us, and we sometimes
        learn ourselves through our decisions, etc.

    <div class="one">
        <B>Being an Experimental Economics researcher</B> helps me think deeply about this world, not only about if the
        causal relationship exist,
        but also underlying mechanisms. For instance, regret matters in decision-making, but only if we know the counterfact,
        and we face the same choice again; people don't absorb every information at the same level, and
        we selectively attribute higher informational value to signals that reinforce our motivation.
