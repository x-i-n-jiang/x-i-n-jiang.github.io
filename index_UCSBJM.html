<h2>Xin Jiang @ UC Santa Barbara</h2>
Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. <br><br>

My research focuses on behavioral and experimental economics. I am particularly interested in understanding peopleâ€™s preference and heuristics in information
acquisition and group affiliation. In my job market paper, we have designed a laboratory experiment to study what response time reveals about the truth, considering the role of heuristics in truth acquisition. <br><br>
  
I'll be on the 2023-2024 job market. <br><br>

  <ul><li><b>The Impact of Response Time on Deceptive Communication</b><br> 
    with <a href="http://www.bohan-ye.com/">Bohan Ye</a>. <a href="current draft.pdf">[working paper]</a><br><br>
  The inclusion of response time indicators has become a common feature in the contemporary landscape of social media sites. 
    Does the response time carry private information, and do people use it to improve their welfare? 
    We design a modified cheap-talk game to study the intricate interplay between response time, 
    private information, and its influence on users' well-being, tailored to situations where truth discovery demands 
    an investment of time. Our investigation uncovers a noteworthy sender inclination towards truth-seeking behaviors, 
    even in cases where deceptive intentions ultimately prevail. This preference makes the difference between different 
    types of decisions nuanced. Consequently, the receivers are unable to extract substantial welfare gains through the 
    interpretation of response times. In addition, when the senders are aware of the availability of their response time, 
    we find that they are able to manipulate it successfully.

While group identity can generate in-group bias, the topic of how activities generate group affiliation is largely
unexplored. We experimentally study the effect of shared experience on group affiliation, varying shared
experiences by paying subjects differently for the same task. The results show that shared fortune leads to
in-group bias, while shared misfortune does not.
